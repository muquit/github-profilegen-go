```bash
github-profilegen-go -user=yourusername
github-profilegen-go -user=yourusername \
    -exclude exclude.txt \
    -priority priority.txt \
    -contact contact.txt
```
If your project is generated with AI assistance and wants to give credit, use
the flag:

```
    -ai-credits ai-credits.txt
```

`README.md` will be created

# Configuration Files

## Exclusion List (exclude.txt)
Contains names of repositories to exclude from the README, one per line:
```

personal-notes
old-project
```

## Priority List (priority.txt)
Contains repository names in the order they should appear at the top of the README:
```

## AI Credits (ai-credits.txt)
If a project is AI assisted and if you would like to give credit, specify a
file with the options `-ai-credits ai-credits.txt`.

An Example file is shown below:
```
